# tapl-haskell

The languages were made using [BNF](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc), specifically calling `bnfc -d -m Lang.cf && make`, where `Lang.cf` is one of the file `.cf` files on the `src/LBNF` folder. The respective generated makefiles are stored there too. The `Doc.pdf` where generated by using
`txt2tags --target=tex Doc.txt` and `pdflatex Doc.tex`.
